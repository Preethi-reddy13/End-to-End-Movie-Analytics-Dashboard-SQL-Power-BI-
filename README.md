📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end data analytics workflow using a movie dataset sourced from Kaggle.

The raw dataset was initially uncleaned and contained missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats. The data was cleaned and transformed using SQL, then connected to Power BI to build an interactive dashboard for movie performance analysis.

The dashboard provides insights into movie profitability, IMDb scores, and social media popularity trends.
